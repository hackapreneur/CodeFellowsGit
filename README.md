Project: Online Barter Feedback Profiles
==============
<b>This is a project plan for my upcoming project 
during the 8-week class session taught by Code Fellows (CodeFellows.com)</b>

By Justin wu

<b>Description:</b>
To create a centralized Trade/Barter review and reputation system for online traders. 
There are people who trade items such as Trading Cards, Guns, Paintball Guns, Toys, Models, Furniture, Art etc everyday.
They faciliate a lot of these trades through forum communities, local, or social media channels.

However the greatest issue is that many of these communities don't have a trade rating system 
implemented to keep track of the postive, negative and neutral feedback.  

Objectives:
<ul>
<li>-Centralized Profile for individuals to show their legitimacy</li>
<li>-eBay Ratings integration </li>
-Add Friends
-Send MEssages
-Provide Reviews on Site
</ul>
