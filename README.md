Project: Online Barter Feedback Profiles
==============
<b>This is a project plan for my upcoming project 
during the 8-week class session taught by Code Fellows (CodeFellows.com)</b>

By Justin wu

<b>Description:</b>
To create a centralized Trade/Barter review and reputation system for online traders. 
There are people who trade items such as Trading Cards, Guns, Paintball Guns, Toys, Models, Furniture, Art etc everyday.
They faciliate a lot of these trades through forum communities, local, or social media channels.

The issue is that many of these communities don't have a trade rating system
implemented to keep track of the postive, negative and neutral feedback.  
Even if they do, users go on multiple of sites and this doesn't help them at all.

This project will also include verification for legitmacy such as Facebook login, phone verification, address verificaiton.

Objectives:
<ul>
  <li>Centralized Profile for individuals to show their legitimacy</li>
  <li>Add Friends</li>
  <ii>Send Messages</li>
  <li>Provide Reviews on Site</li>
  <li>Verification</li>
  <li>eBay Ratings integration </li>
</ul>
